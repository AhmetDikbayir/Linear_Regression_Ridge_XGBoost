# Linear_Regression_Ridge_XGBoost
I used a dataset which can be reached on the github account. There 200 entries and 4 attributes. They are TV advertisement, Radio adv., Newspaper advertisement and Sales. I tried to predict how sales can be effected by the advertisement type. I used Linear regression, Ridge and XGBoost Regressor Model.
